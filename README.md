## 📌 Project Overview

This project is a case study from the **Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning** program. It explores a real-world dataset from a bike-sharing system and demonstrates the use of **ensemble learning techniques** (Bagging, Boosting, Stacking) to analyze patterns in bike rental data and predict rental counts.

The project simulates the role of a data scientist at a company named **Travel Along**, tasked with providing data-driven insights and predictive models to optimize operations and enhance customer service.

## 🧠 Problem Statement

### Business Context

Bike-sharing systems automate the rental process and are widely adopted for their convenience and impact on traffic and the environment. Understanding customer behavior is key to managing demand.

### Objective

- Analyze factors influencing the number of bike rentals.
- Provide actionable insights for business improvement.
- Predict total bike rental counts using ensemble models.
